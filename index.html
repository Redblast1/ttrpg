                Mergi is a high fantasy custom setting made by Redblast1. It is a continent found trapped within tall scorching-hot volcanic rock walls. 
                Tension has started to build once again between the factions around Mergi: the constant fighitng of the Monarchy with the Indipendent City-States, 
                or the Neutral factions facing a looming threat from the sea, sky, or the mists. However, one thing is clear: the Quest for Ascension continues. 
                Who will find a way to clear the Cage?
