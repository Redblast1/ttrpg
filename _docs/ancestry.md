Before beginning, keep in mind that everything you would need is available on [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=66) for ***free***. It will go into a lot more depth than I will here, and instead of just copy-pasting everything to another site, I highly encourage using the site primarily, learning where things are layed out and everything.
