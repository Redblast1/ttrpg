## Getting started

To begin, start with a concept maybe. Sometimes it's easier to think "Han Solo but a paladin, whos also a goblin" or something like that. If you're not sure, sometimes just looking through the Ancestries and Classes can spark ideas to try out. 

A popular way to think about the process is follow your "ABC"s. **Ancestry**. **Background**. **Class**. 

Each section will have a page on the left-side of the page. For setting specific info check the section below that.

### **General steps to making a character**
1. Select an [*Ancestry*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx), this determines if your character is a goblin, a human, or one of the other available options. [There are quite a lot of options in Pathfinder 2E](https://i.redd.it/f3936k7yso3a1.png). These can range from Common, Uncommon, or Rare- ask your GM if an option is available for the game. With this decision, there are also *Heritages*, which further define the culture or where your character comes from.
2. Next would be your [*Background*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx), which defines what you did in life before adventuring. This helps shape your character's past. It could be years of hard work in one area, or some definning moment that changed the course of life, or a circumstance or hardship overcame. 
3. Finally there is the important decision of what [*Class*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx) the character is. This defines their adventuring abilities or skills.
4. Finalzie the Ability Boosts, Skills, and Feats that each step awarded.
5. Select [*Equipment*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=1), at level 1 you start with 15 gold. You can select weapons, tools, adventuring gear individually, or go by the [*Class Kits*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=240) which show you an easy group of items to pickout for this step.  
6. If you cast [*Spells*](https://2e.aonprd.com/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=0), you may need to select those, too!
