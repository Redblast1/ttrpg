## Getting started

To begin, start with a concept maybe. Sometimes its easier to think "Han Solo but a paladin, whos also a goblin" or something like that. If you're not sure, sometimes just looking through the Ancestries and Classes can spark ideas to try out. 

A popular way to think about the process is follow your "ABC"s. **Ancestry**. **Background**. **Class**. 

Each section will have a page on the left-side of the page. For setting specific info check the section below that.
